# ChirpStack Packet Multiplexer

The ChirpStack Packet Multiplexer makes it possible to connect gateways using
the [Semtech UDP packet-forwarder protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT)
to multiple servers, with the option to mark servers as uplink only.

## Install

### Binaries

Pre-compiled binaries can be downloaded from [https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/downloads/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer/](https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/downloads/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer/).

### Docker

Docker images can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/r/chirpstack/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/chirpstack/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer/tags).

### Debian / Ubuntu

ChirpStack provides a Debian / Ubuntu repository which can be used to install
the ChirpStack Packet Multiplexer. First make sure that `gpg` is installed:

```
sudo apt install gpg
```

Set up the key for the ChirpStack repository:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
sudo sh -c 'wget -q -O - https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/packages/chirpstack.key | gpg --dearmor > /etc/apt/keyrings/chirpstack.gpg'
```

Add the repository to the repository list:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/chirpstack.gpg] https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/packages/4.x/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chirpstack.list
```

Update the apt package cache:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install `chirpstack-packet-multiplexer`:

```
sudo apt install chirpstack-packet-multiplexer
```

To complete the installation, update the configuration file which is located
at `/etc/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer.toml` and (re)start
the service:

```
sudo systemctl restart chirpstack-packet-multiplexer
```

## Building from source

### Requirements

Building ChirpStack Packet Multiplexer requires:

* [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

#### Nix

Nix is used for setting up the development environment which is used for local
development and for creating the binaries.

If you do not have Nix installed and do not wish to install it, then you can
also replicate the development environment by installing the packages listed
in `shell.nix` manually.

#### Docker

Docker is used by [cross-rs](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) for cross-compiling,
as well as some of the `make` commands.

### Starting the development shell

Run the following command to start the development shell:

```bash
nix-shell
```

### Running tests

Execute the following command to run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

### Building binaries

Execute the following commands to build the ChirpStack Packet Multiplexer binaries
and packages:

```bash
# Only build binaries
make build

# Build binaries + distributable packages.
make dist
```

## Usage

Run `chirpstack-packet-multiplexer --help` for usage information.

## Example configuration

Executing `chirpstack-packet-multiplexer configfile` returns the following configuration
template:

```toml
# Logging settings.
[logging]

  # Log level.
  #
  # Valid options are:
  #   * TRACE
  #   * DEBUG
  #   * INFO
  #   * WARN
  #   * ERROR
  level = "info"


# Multiplexer configuration.
[multiplexer]

  # Interface:port of UDP bind.
  #
  # This this is the interface:port on which the Multiplexer will receive
  # data from the gateways.
  bind = "0.0.0.0:1700"

  # Servers to forward gateway data to.
  #
  # Example configuration:
  # [[multiplexer.server]]

  #   # Hostname:port of the server.
  #   server="example.com:1700"

  #   # Only allow uplink.
  #   #
  #   # If set to true, any downlink will be discarded.
  #   uplink_only=false

  #   # Gateway ID prefix filters.
  #   #
  #   # If not set, data of all gateways will be forwarded. If set, only data
  #   # from gateways with a matching Gateway ID will be forwarded.
  #   #
  #   # Example:
  #   # * "0102030405060708/32": Exact match (all 32 bits of the filter must match)
  #   # * "0102030400000000/16": All gateway IDs starting with "01020304" (filter on 16 most significant bits)
  #   gateway_id_prefixes=[]
  #
  #   # Filter configuration.
  #   [multiplexer.server.filters]

  #     # DevAddr prefix filters.
  #     #
  #     # Example configuration:
  #     # dev_addr_prefixes=["0000ff00/24"]
  #     #
  #     # The above filter means that the 24MSB of 0000ff00 will be used to
  #     # filter DevAddrs. Uplinks with DevAddrs that do not match any of the
  #     # configured filters will not be forwarded. Leaving this option empty
  #     # disables filtering on DevAddr.
  #     dev_addr_prefixes=[]

  #     # JoinEUI prefix filters.
  #     #
  #     # Example configuration:
  #     # join_eui_prefixes=["0000ff0000000000/24"]
  #     #
  #     # The above filter means that the 24MSB of 0000ff0000000000 will be used
  #     # to filter JoinEUIs. Uplinks with JoinEUIs that do not match any of the
  #     # configured filters will not be forwarded. Leaving this option empty
  #     # disables filtering on JoinEUI.
  #     join_eui_prefixes=[]


# Monitoring configuration.
[monitoring]

  # Interface:port.
  #
  # If set, this will enable the monitoring endpoints. If not set, the endpoint
  # will be disabled. Endpoints:
  #
  # * /metrics: Exposes Prometheus metrics.
  bind = ""
```

## Docker Compose example

```
services:
  chirpstack-packet-multiplexer:
    image: chirpstack/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer:4.0.0-test.3
    command: -c /etc/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer.toml
    ports:
      - 1700:1700/udp
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/chirpstack-packet-multiplexer
```

The above example assumes that you have a local configuration directory named
`config` which contains a `chirpstack-packet-multiplexer.toml` file.
